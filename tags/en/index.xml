      <description>Some time ago I realised that there is no a library to keep a stack of strings in a text file efficiently in Python. So I coded own one. I commented the code, and I suppose that any additional words will be redundant.

      <description>After updating at my work Kubernetes cluster and updating Prometheus Operator, was updated its component – kube-state-metrics to 2.3.0. Early when vesrions were used 1.4.0 and 1.7.0, there is no problem because it is back compitable. But since 2.0.0 was deleted some metric. And I need to discover this, because some of them was used in alerts!
For that I wrote 3 scripts:
Get 1.4.0 metrics #! /bin/bash  PATH_TO_CODE=&amp;#34;./pkg/collectors&amp;#34; WORD_TO_FIND=&amp;#34;prometheus.</description>

      <description>Hi! So, about prometheus configuration updating on the fly.
Update configution file The one problem is the deleting configuration file and changing inode file data.
Upload file to remote server and update conf file there:
import paramiko hostname = &amp;#34;example.com&amp;#34; username = &amp;#34;user ssh = paramiko.SSHClient() ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) ssh.connect(hostname=hostname, username=username) sftp = ssh.open_sftp() # https://docs.paramiko.org/en/stable/api/sftp.html#paramiko.sftp_client.SFTPClient.file with sftp.file(target_file, &amp;#39;w+&amp;#39;) as output, open(local_file, &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;) as input: while True: try: buffer = input.read(5000) # 5KB if buffer == &amp;#39;&amp;#39;: print(&amp;#34;Uploading was finished&amp;#34;) break output.</description>

      <description>Hello there!
I&amp;rsquo;ve met a problem with using SQLAlchemy framework. Look below:
db.session.add(AnObject) try: db.session.commit() except: db.session.rollback() An error in commit() cause the call to get a new sequence of the table primary key. It updates the sequence number like:
SELECT nextval(&amp;#39;table_id_seq&amp;#39;); I&amp;rsquo;d expected that rollback() must roll it back, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t. I tried to find solution at michaelcho.me but it was unsuccessful.
Solving First what may be found is the next command:</description>

      <description>Everytime when I am doing a something by Python (or by something else) I need to use articles about main libraries. Despite that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it a lot of times, it just can&amp;rsquo;t fit in my head. So I wrote this article to get the information quickly.
Basically it consist links to russian resources.

      <description>Nginx reverse proxy needs where we want to get access to few resources by one external IP address and port.
I used that for several http web services (debian repository, my website and phpmyadmin). The following config is pairing server_name and proxy_pass as target location. Pleese look at last section with default_server atribute. It needs to set default site (in this case page with 501 Internal Error).
Quickstart   Create webproxy.</description>
