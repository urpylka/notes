      <description>Hello there!
I&amp;rsquo;ve met a problem with using SQLAlchemy framework. Look below:
db.session.add(AnObject) try: db.session.commit() except: db.session.rollback() An error in commit() cause the call to get a new sequence of the table primary key. It updates the sequence number like:
SELECT nextval(&amp;#39;table_id_seq&amp;#39;); I&amp;rsquo;d expected that rollback() must roll it back, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t. I tried to find solution at michaelcho.me but it was unsuccessful.

      <description>Nginx reverse proxy needs where we want to get access to few resources by one external IP address and port.
I used that for several http web services (debian repository, my website and phpmyadmin). The following config is pairing server_name and proxy_pass as target location. Pleese look at last section with default_server atribute. It needs to set default site (in this case page with 501 Internal Error).
Quickstart   Create webproxy.</description>
